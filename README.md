A great cheers to [Write your own OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4&list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M&index=1) for putting up such an amazing Youtube Playlist.

Also, [Writing Simple OS from scratch](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) is probably one of the best books I have ever read about how to build a minimal Operating system!
